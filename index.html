            Forests are the largest terrestrial ecosystem of Earth by area, and
            are found around the globe.45 percent of forest land is in the
            tropical latitudes. The next largest share of forests are found in
            subarctic climates, followed by temperate, and subtropical zones.
            Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the
            Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. Net
            primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes of biomass per
            year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for
            boreal forests.

            A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally
            with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although
            definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a
            limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically
            rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A
            few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain
            ranges. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or
            volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of
            years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled
            through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms
            of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.

            A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and
            the sea. The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the wider body of
            seawater. Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order
            sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain
            large, nearly landlocked bodies of water. The salinity of water
            bodies varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of
            large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the
            relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the
            oceans. The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium
            chloride. The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium,
            potassium, and mercury, amongst many other elements, some in minute
            concentrations.
